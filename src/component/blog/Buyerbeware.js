          Due to anonymous nature of crypto transactions, it becomes easy for
          any channel owner to ban you or forbid you from reaching them without
          any legal or financial redressals available. <br />
          <br /> Before choosing to buy any memberships, Be triple sure into

        view of 2k per post.{" "}
        <strong>
          However, we have spotted that their normal post view even until 6-8
          hours of posting is less than 75 (which after 8-12 hrs inflate to
          1-2.2k views)
        </strong>{" "}
        which leads us to conclude their real members are below 100-250 and rest
        are all fake (Paid views purchased from engagement boost websites).

      <p className="lead">
        <strong>
          This channel seems to be a backup for Atal (Aka Nishant Mahajan) run
          along with his brother (Anjum mahajan).
          <br /> It is indirectly being promoted by twitter follows and scam ads
          by Forex Tradings and team We request everyone to be prudent in
          judging results posted by channels in their public channel (Specially
          their forwards from Paid channel) <br />
        </strong>
        <br />
        <i>
          For ex, like we see their public channel has only 50-80 Real views, It
          is entirely possible to have a fake VIP clone where they can post any
          call and forward it to public. <br />
          Ex : Make a BNB short call today (When BNB is at 302$) in a fake clone
          VIP Channelk Entry at 314/330$ and enter date for call as 14/08/2022
          Then send this today to your public channel as if the call was made on
          14/08.
          <br />
        </i>
        <br />
        <strong>
          This sort of added dark behaviors are possible on channels with less
          public exposure, beware. Never blindly believe anyone selling you
          memberships. Takes them 2 seconds to kick you out of the paid channel
          when you spot their scam / Question them!
